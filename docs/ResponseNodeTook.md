## Methods

### NewResponseNodeTook

`func NewResponseNodeTook(isIngester bool, node string, took int32, ) *ResponseNodeTook`

NewResponseNodeTook instantiates a new ResponseNodeTook object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewResponseNodeTookWithDefaults

`func NewResponseNodeTookWithDefaults() *ResponseNodeTook`

NewResponseNodeTookWithDefaults instantiates a new ResponseNodeTook object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetIsIngester

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetIsIngester() bool`

GetIsIngester returns the IsIngester field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetIsIngesterOk

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetIsIngesterOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetIsIngesterOk returns a tuple with the IsIngester field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetIsIngester

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) SetIsIngester(v bool)`

SetIsIngester sets IsIngester field to given value.


### GetNode

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetNode() string`

GetNode returns the Node field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetNodeOk

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetNodeOk() (*string, bool)`

GetNodeOk returns a tuple with the Node field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetNode

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) SetNode(v string)`

SetNode sets Node field to given value.


### GetTook

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetTook() int32`

GetTook returns the Took field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetTookOk

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) GetTookOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetTookOk returns a tuple with the Took field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetTook

`func (o *ResponseNodeTook) SetTook(v int32)`

SetTook sets Took field to given value.
